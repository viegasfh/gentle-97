   INSTALLATION
   ------------


   Unpacking the Gentle distribution file creates a directory `gentle-97'
   that includes subdirectories `gentle', `lib', and `reflex'.

   Go to directory `gentle' and type

	 build

   This creates the executable program `gentle', the Gentle compiler,
   as well as the the object file `grts.o', the Gentle runtime system.

   Go to directory `lib' and type

	 build

   This compiles the modules of the user library.

   Go to directory `reflex' and type

	 build

   This creates the executable program `reflex',
   a generator for Lex specifications.

   Consult the file `docs/USAGE' for instructions
   how to run a first example.

   Refer to the manual `Getting Started' for further details.
