<h1>Handling Global Information</h1>

<p>
<i> Gentle</i> encourages a declarative style of programming.
However, there are cases in which non declarative elements are appropriate.
<p>
One problem is parameter lists that tend to get too long if every bit of
context information is passed explicitly.
<p>
Consider a programming language that features a loop-statement
and exit-statement and specifies that an exit-statement can only occur inside
a loop statement. To check this constraint, the predicate that processes
statements would have to be equipped with a parameter indicating
whether one is inside or outside a loop. This parameter must be passed
for each statement, e.g. an if-statement, because a constituent
of that statement - e.g. the then-part - could contain an exit-statement.
On the other hand, the constraint checking involves only
the loop-statement and the exit-statement.
<p>
<i> Gentle</i> provides global variables.
They are often used to represent
a concept that is global to the concept processed by a particular rule.
<p>
A global variable is introduced by a declaration of the form
<ul>
<li>

   <tt> 'var'</tt> <i>Name</i> : <i>Type</i>
</ul>

For example,
<PRE>

   'var' CurLoopContext: LoopContext
</PRE>
declares a global variable with the name <tt> CurLoopContext</tt> of type
<tt> LoopContext</tt> (for which we assume values <tt> inside</tt>
and <tt> outside</tt>).
<p>
This variable cannot be used inside expressions and patterns.
The only way to manipulate and inspect its value is the
<i> update statement</i> and the <i> query statement</i>
that can be used as a member in a rule body.
<p>
The update statement has the form
<ul>
<li>

   <i>Name</i> <tt> <-</tt> <i>Expression</i>
</ul>

which assigns the value of the <i>Expression</i> to the variable given by <i>Name</i>.
<p>
For example,
<PRE>

   CurLoopContext <- outside
</PRE>
sets the variable <tt> CurLoopContext</tt> to <tt> outside</tt>.
The old value of the variable gets lost.
<p>
The query statement has the form 
<ul>
<li>

   <i>Name</i> <tt> -></tt> <i>Pattern</i>
</ul>

It takes the value of the variable and matches it against the
given pattern. This may succeed, defining the variable inside the pattern.
It may also fail, in which case the query statements fails.
<p>
For example,
<PRE>

   CurLoopContext -> outside
</PRE>
succeeds only if the variable holds the value <tt> outside</tt>.
<p>
<PRE>

   CurLoopContext -> K
</PRE>
defines a new local variable of type <tt> LoopContext</tt> whose value
is the current value of <tt> CurLoopContext</tt>.
<p>
It is an error to access a global variable in a query statement
if the variable has not been defined by a preceding update statement.
This error is checked when the query statement is executed.
Hence, term data structures cannot be corrupted by uninitialized
global variables.
<p>
We now show how the above loop exit constraint can be checked.
Assume that a predicate <tt> ProcessStatement</tt> traverses the abstract syntax of
statements (we leave out all details). This could be extended
at two points:
<PRE>

   'rule' ProcessStatement(loop(Body)):
      CurLoopContext -> OldLoopContext
      CurLoopContext <- inside
      ProcessStatement(Body)
      CurLoopContext <- OldLoopContext
</PRE>
<PRE>

   'rule' ProcessStatement(exit):
      CurLoopContext -> K
      CheckContextForExit(K)
</PRE>
