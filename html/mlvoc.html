<h1>Notation, Terminology, and Vocabulary</h1>

<p>
The syntax is described in Extended  Backus Naur Form.   Syntactic constructs
are  denoted  by  (abbreviated) English words consisting of upper- and
lower-case letters, and containing at least one lower-case letter.
The  angular  brackets  <  and  > are omitted.
Strings of letters consisting solely of
upper-case letters stand for themselves, i.e. for reserved identifiers of  the
language.   Strings of characters enclosed in single quotes ' '
are also to be
taken literally.  Square  brackets  [ ]
denote  optional  constructs.   Curly
brackets  { }  stand
for  zero or more repetitions of the enclosed construct.
Alternative constructs are separated by a vertical bar |.  Parentheses
( ) are
used for grouping.
<p>
     The basic vocabulary of <i> MiniLAX</i> consists of basic symbols classified into
delimiters, identifiers, and constants.
<p>
     Spaces, line ends, and comments may occur anywhere in  a  program  except
within  a  basic  symbol.   At least one space, line end or comment must occur
between any two adjacent identifiers or constants.   Otherwise,  spaces,  line
ends, and comments do not influence the meaning of a program.
<p>
     A comment has the form
<PRE>

   '(*' any sequence of characters not containing *) '*)'
</PRE>

<h3>Delimiters</h3>

Delimiters are reserved identifiers or (strings of)  special characters.
<PRE>

Delim ::= ':' | ';' | ':=' | '(' | ')' | '.' | ','
      | '..' | '[' | ']' | '+' | '*' | '<'
      | 'ARRAY' | 'BEGIN' | 'BOOLEAN' | 'DECLARE' | 'DO'
      | 'ELSE' | 'END' | 'FALSE' | 'IF' | 'INTEGER'
      | 'NOT' |'OF' | 'PROCEDURE' | 'PROGRAM' | 'READ'
      | 'REAL' |'THEN' | 'TRUE' | 'VAR' | 'WHILE'
      | 'WRITE'
</PRE>

<h3>Identifiers</h3>

Identifiers serve to denote  variables  and  procedures.
Their  association  must be unique within their scope of validity, i.e. within
the procedure or function in which they are declared.
<PRE>

Id ::= Letter { Letter | Digit }
</PRE>

All letters and digits of an identifier are significant.  Upper and lower case
letters  are  distinguished.  Delimiters are reserved identifiers that cannot
be used otherwise.
<p>
<h3>Numbers</h3>

The usual decimal notation is used for  numbers,  which  are
the  constants  of  the data types integer and real.  The letter 'E' preceding
the scale factor is pronounced as "'times"10
<PRE>

IntConst    ::= Digit { Digit }
RealConst   ::= [ IntConst ] '.' IntConst [ ScaleFactor ]
ScaleFactor ::= 'E' [ '+' | '-' ] IntConst
</PRE>

Examples:

1   100   .1   87.35E-8
