<h1>Syntax Definitions</h1>

<p>
Using this grammatical interpretation of rules we can write
<PRE>

   'rule' Program : Declarationpart Statementpart
</PRE>
which states that a <tt> Program</tt> is given by a <tt> Declarationpart</tt>
and a <tt> Statementpart</tt>.
<p>
We also need basic symbols of the language that are not defined by
rules. These symbols are called <i> terminal symbols</i> or <i> tokens</i>
and are written as strings denoting themselves.
For example,
<PRE>

   'rule' Statement : "IF" Expression "THEN" Statement "ELSE" Statement
</PRE>
Here, <tt> "IF"</tt>, <tt> "THEN"</tt>, and <tt> "ELSE"</tt> are terminal symbols.
<p>
Grammatical symbols such as <tt> Statement</tt> that are defined by
rules are called <i> nonterminal symbols</i>.
<p>
A grammar not only describes what is a valid text of a language, but
also imposes a structure on the text.
A grammar is given by a set of terminal symbols,
a set of nonterminal symbols, and a set of rules.
Rules have the form:
<ul>
<li>

'rule' <i>A</i> : <i>B<SUB>1</SUB></i> <i>B<SUB>2</SUB></i> ... <i>B<SUB>n</SUB></i>
</ul>

where <i>A</i> is a nonterminal and the <i>B<SUB>i</SUB></i> are terminal or nonterminal
symbols.
A valid phrase of class <i>A</i> can be constructed by replacing
each <i>B<SUB>i</SUB></i> by a valid phrase of <i>B<SUB>i</SUB></i> (if <i>B<SUB>i</SUB></i> is a terminal, the
valid phrase is the terminal itself).
<p>
Given the rule for <tt> Statement</tt> and assuming that
<tt> x>y</tt> is an expression and that <tt> x:=x-y</tt> and <tt> y:=y-x</tt>
are statements, we can construct the more complex statement
<PRE>

   IF x>y THEN x:=x-y ELSE y:=y-x
</PRE>

The distinction between tokens and nonterminals reflects the fact
that the analysis of the input text is generally decomposed into
two (interleaved) steps:
First the input is partitioned into tokens (lexical analysis),
then the token stream is structured into hierarchical phrases
(syntax analysis). Different techniques are used for each task.
