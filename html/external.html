<h1>Using Types and Predicates Written in C</h1>

<p>
<i> Gentle</i> tries to cover most tasks of compiler writing
within a high-level uniform framework.
However, there are also tasks for which languages like <i> C</i>
are better suited. 
<p>
<i> Gentle</i> allows the user to implement types and predicates in <i> C</i>,
but use them as if they were implemented in <i> Gentle</i>.
<p>
The <i> Gentle</i> system comes with some ready-to-use
<i> C</i> types and functions that are accessible in this way. 
The mechanism may also be applied by the user to build his or her own
external types and functions.
