<h1>Unparsing</h1>

<p>
The above scheme is called an <i> unparsing scheme</i>.
While a parser reads a source text (driven by the
structure of the source text)  and constructs abstract syntax,
an unparser processes abstract syntax terms (driven by their structure)
and emits a concrete target program.
<p>
The rules of an unparser are similar to grammar rules.
Predicates like <tt> StackCode</tt> correspond to nonterminals,
and predicates that directly emit target code correspond to tokens.
In a source grammar, symbols are decorated with output parameters
that specify their abstract representation. 
In a target grammar,  symbols are decorated with abstract input parameters
for which a concrete representation has to be generated.
<p>
In many cases an unparsing scheme simply follows the structure
of terms. In general there is one rule for each functor,
although sometimes larger patterns are used.
This results in a functional description
such as that for the stack-computer code generator.
<p>
This will especially be the case if the target language is 
a higher-level language, as in source-to-source translations
(e.g. if a parallel extension of <i> C</i> is translated into
plain <i> C</i>).
