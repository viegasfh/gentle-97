<h1>Dataflow</h1>

In our example, the variables <tt> A</tt> and <tt> B</tt> are defined outside
the alternative statement. They can be used inside.
<p>
The general rule is:
A variable that is used in a pattern
must be in a defined state at the beginning of the whole alternative statement,
or must defined by a preceding member of the same alternative.
<p>
In the example, the variable <tt> C</tt> is used after the alternative statement,
and has no definition outside the alternative statement.
This is allowed because it is defined in both alternatives. Regardless of
which alternative is taken, <tt> C</tt> would be defined in all cases
(if no alternative is applicable then statement using <tt> C</tt> will not be
reached).
<p>
The general rule is:
A variable that is defined in all alternatives is said to be defined
by the whole alternative statement, and may be used subsequently.
If a variable is defined in all alternatives, it must be defined
everywhere with the same type.
<p>
If a variable is defined in one or more - but not all - alternatives,
it is said to be <i> local</i> to the alternative containing the definition
and cannot be used outside the alternative statement.
<p>
If, in the above example, we had written
<PRE>

   (| ge(A, B) process(A -> ResultA) || process(B -> ResultB) |)
</PRE>
neither <tt> ResultA</tt> nor <tt> ResultB</tt> could have been used in a
subsequent statement because it could not be guaranteed that it is
always defined.
