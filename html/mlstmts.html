<h1>Statements</h1>

<p>
     Statements denote algorithmic actions, and are said to be executable.
<p>
<PRE>

Stat ::= AssignStat | CondStat | LoopStat | ProcStat
</PRE>

<p>
<h3>Statement sequences</h3>

A statement sequence  specifies  that  its  component statements are to be executed in the same sequence as they are written.
<p>
<PRE>

StatSeq ::= Stat { ';' Stat }
</PRE>

<p>
<h3>Assignment Statements</h3>

The assignment statement serves to replace the
current value of a variable by a new value specified as an expression.
<p>
<PRE>

AssignStat ::= Var ':=' Expr
</PRE>

Examples:
<p>
<PRE>

i := i+1
r := r*3.141592
b := i<1
a[4][2] := r
</PRE>

The variable and the expression must be of identical type, with the  following
exception  being  permitted: The type of the variable is REAL, and the type of
the expression is INTEGER.  In any case, the variable  must  be  of  a  simple
type.
<p>
<h3>Procedure Statements</h3>

A procedure statement  serves  to  execute  the
procedure  denoted  by  the procedure identifier.  The procedure statement may
contain a list of actual parameters which are substituted in  place  of  their
corresponding  formal  parameters  defined  in the procedure declaration.  The
correspondence is established by the positions of the parameters in the  lists
of actual and formal parameters respectively.  There exist two kinds of
parameters: value parameters and variable parameters.
<p>
In the case of a value parameter, the actual parameter must be an 
expression (of which a variable is a simple case).
The corresponding formal parameter represents a local variable of the
called procedure, and the current value
of  the  expression  is initially assigned to this variable.  Value parameters
must have a simple type.  In the case of  a  variable  parameter,  the  actual
parameter  must  be  a variable of the same type, and the corresponding formal
parameter represents this actual variable during the entire execution  of  the
procedure.   If  this  variable  is  a  component  of  an  array, its index is
evaluated when the procedure is called.  A variable  parameter  must  be  used
whenever the parameter represents a result of the procedure.
<p>
<PRE>

ProcStat ::= Id [ '(' Expr { ',' Expr } ')' ]
</PRE>

Examples:
<p>
<PRE>

next   Transpose(a,m,n)
</PRE>

<h3>Conditional Statements</h3>

The if statement specifies that  a  statement
be  executed  only if a certain condition (Boolean expression) is true.  If it
is false, the statement following the delimiter ELSE is to be executed.
<p>
<PRE>

CondStat ::= 'IF' Expr 'THEN' StatSeq
             'ELSE' StatSeq 'END'
</PRE>

Examples:
<p>
<PRE>

IF i < 0 THEN i := 1 ELSE i := 2 END
</PRE>

The expression between the delimiters IF and THEN must be of type Boolean.
<p>
<h3>Repetitive Statements</h3>

The while statement specifies that  a  certain
statement is to be executed repeatedly.
<p>
<PRE>

LoopStat ::= 'WHILE' Expr 'DO' StatSeq 'END'
</PRE>

The expression controlling repetition must be of type Boolean.  The  statement
is  repeatedly executed as long as the expression is true.  If it evaluates to
false at the beginning, the statement is  not  executed  at  all.   The  while
statement
<p>
<PRE>

WHILE b DO s END
</PRE>

is equivalent to
<p>
<PRE>

IF b
THEN s; WHILE b DO s END
ELSE (* nothing *)
END
</PRE>

Examples:
<p>
<PRE>

WHILE a [i] < r DO i := i + 1 END

WHILE i < n DO
   r := 2 * r;
   i := i + 1
END
</PRE>

<h3>Declarations</h3>

Procedure declarations serve to define  parts
of  programs  and  to  associate  identifiers  with  them  so that they can be
activated by procedure statements.
<p>
<PRE>

ProcDecl ::= ProcHead ';' Block
Block    ::= 'DECLARE' Decl { ';' Decl }
             'BEGIN' StatSeq 'END'
Decl     ::= VarDecl | ProcDecl
</PRE>

The procedure heading specifies the identifier naming the  procedure  and  the
formal  parameter  identifiers  (if  any).  The parameters are either value or
variable parameters.
<p>
<PRE>

ProcHead ::= 'PROCEDURE' Id 
             [ '(' Formal { ';' Formal } ')' ]
Formal   ::= [ 'VAR' ] Id ':' Type
</PRE>

If a formal starts with the delimiter VAR it specifies a  variable  parameter,
otherwise a value parameter.
<p>
     The statement sequence of the block specifies the algorithmic actions  to
be executed upon an activation of the procedure by a procedure statement.
<p>
     All identifiers introduced in the formal parameter part of the  procedure
heading  and  in the declaration part of the associated block are local to the
procedure declaration which is called the scope of  these  identifiers.   They
are  not  known  outside  their  scope.  In the case of local variables, their
values are undefined at the beginning of the statement part.
<p>
     The use of the procedure identifier in a procedure statement  within  its
declaration implies recursive execution of the procedure.
<p>
Examples of procedure declarations:
<p>
<PRE>

PROCEDURE ReadPosInteger (VAR i: INTEGER);
DECLARE
  j: INTEGER;
BEGIN
  i := 0;
  WHILE NOT (0 < i) DO READ (i) END
END

PROCEDURE Sort
  (VAR a: ARRAY [1..10] OF REAL; n: INTEGER);
DECLARE
  i: INTEGER; j: INTEGER; k: INTEGER; h: REAL;
BEGIN
  i := 1;
  WHILE i < n DO
    (* a [1], ... , a [i] is sorted *)
    j := i; k := i;
    WHILE j < n DO
      (* a [k] = min {a [i], ... , a [j]} *)
      j := j + 1;
      IF a [j] < a [k] THEN k := j ELSE k := k END
    END;
    h := a [i]; a [i] := a [k]; a [k] := h;
    i := i + 1
  END
END
</PRE>
