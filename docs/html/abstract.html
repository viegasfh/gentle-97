<h1>Abstract Syntax</h1>

<p>
It is advisable not to mix up the syntactic description of a language with
its semantic analysis and transformation but to separate concerns.
The syntax description gives the concrete grammar of the language and
introduces a more abstract term representation. This term representation
is then processed by predicates that follow the structure of these terms.
This pays off because abstract syntax is usually much simpler than concrete
syntax and because predicate evaluation is much more flexible
than interleaving computations with parsing.
<p>
Given a concrete grammar, a straight forward way
of defining an abstract representation
is simply to mirror the grammar by term definitions.
<p>
For each nonterm there is corresponding type;
for each grammar rule there is a corresponding functor.
Terms with this functor have an argument for each nonterm and for each
named token.
Each nonterm has one attribute, its term representation. This is
constructed from term representation of the members of the rule body.
<p>
For example,
the nonterm <tt> Statement</tt> from above gets an associated type
<tt> STATEMENT</tt> which is defined as follows:
<PRE>

   'type' STATEMENT
      assignment(VARIABLE, EXPRESSION)
      if(EXPRESSION, STATEMENT, STATEMENT)
      while(EXPRESSION, STATEMENT)
      compound(STMTSEQ)
</PRE>
We can then decorate the above grammar:
<PRE>

   'nonterm' Statement(-> STATEMENT)

      'rule' Statement(-> assignment(V, E)):
         Variable(-> V) ":=" Expression(-> E)
      'rule' Statement(-> if(E, S1, S2)):
         "IF" Expression(-> E) "THEN" Statement(-> S1)
         "ELSE" Statement(-> S2)
      'rule' Statement(-> while(E, S)):
         "WHILE" Expression(-> E) "DO" Statement(-> S)
      'rule' Statement(-> compound(S)):
         "BEGIN" StmtSeq(-> S) "END"
</PRE>

Abstract syntax can be simpler than concrete syntax.
<p>
Since abstract syntax has a unique tree structure, it is not necessary
to reflect binding strength using different types, as we did with
different nonterminals to avoid ambiguity.
For example,
in a preceding example, the nonterminals
<tt> expression</tt> (introducing additive operators)
and <tt> expr2</tt> (introducing multiplicative operators)
both have an argument of type <tt> Expr</tt> that covers all operators.
<p>
Abstract syntax can allow cases that are forbidden in concrete syntax.
For example,
whereas in concrete syntax a list may require at least one member,
in abstract syntax one could use empty lists.
(Lists that are terminated by an empty tail, <tt> nil</tt>,
are simpler to process because the rule for the end of the list
does not have to deal with a list member.)
<p>
Abstract syntax can normalize cases in which the concrete syntax
allows several representations for the same meaning, e.g.
<tt> A[i,j]</tt> and <tt> A[i][j]</tt>
in <i> Pascal</i>.
<p>
Abstract syntax can simplify complex constructs of the concrete syntax
enforced by restrictions of the parsing strategy.
