<h1>Token Predicates</h1>

<p>
Besides recognizing tokens that appear literally in the grammar,
lexical analysis often also deals with items that appear
as atoms for syntactic analysis but are structured at a lower level.
An example of this are numbers that are treated as tokens, but
specified as a sequence of digits at the level of lexical analysis.
<p>
Things like blanks, comments, and other separators that do not
contribute to the syntactic structure are usually filtered out by
lexical analysis as white space.
Thus one criterion for deciding whether an item should be handled as a token
is whether its components can be separated by white space:
in a <tt> Statement</tt> a newline can (or must) appear between <tt> IF</tt>
and the following <tt> Expression</tt>.
In a <tt> Number</tt> this is not allowed as it would split the number into two
tokens.
<p>
A complex token is introduced as a predicate of the category <tt> token</tt>.
A predicate of this category is not defined by rules.
<p>
For example,
a token <tt> Variable</tt> can be declared as
<PRE>

   'token' Variable
</PRE>
and can then be used as member of a rule body:
<PRE>

   'rule' Statement: Variable ":=" Expression
</PRE>
The declaration of a token does not provide rules.
The actual description is given outside the <i> Gentle</i>
specification. In many cases existing descriptions can be reused.
<p>
(See the manual on the <i> Reflex</i> tool for
details of how to describe tokens and white space conventions.)
