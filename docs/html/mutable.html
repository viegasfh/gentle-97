<h1>Handling Mutable Information</h1>

Besides global variables, <i> tables</i>
are another data structure that can be updated.
They are motivated by the observation that in certain cases
not all information required to construct a term is already available,
and we need a mechanism to supply this later.
As we will see, tables may also be used to represent cyclic structures.
<p>
In <i> Gentle</i>, one cannot modify the fields of a term, but one
can supply an immutable key, that refers to a mutable record.
<p>
A <i> table</i> is an unbounded collection of records.
Each record is identified by a unique key.
A record is a list of one or more mutable fields.
<p>
A <i> table declaration</i>
has the form
<ul>
<li>

<tt> 'table'</tt> <i>Name</i> <tt> (</tt> <i>Fields</i> <tt> )</tt>
</ul>

where <i>Fields</i> is a comma-separated list of one or more field specifications.
The identifier <i> Name</i> serves as a type name for the keys.
<p>
A field is specified in the form
<ul>
<li>

<i>FieldName</i> <tt> :</tt> <i>Type</i>
</ul>

<p>
To illustrate the use of tables,
let us discuss the so-called basic-block-graph representation of programs.
In this representation, the instructions of a program are grouped
into blocks
(only the last instruction of a block can be a jump;
only the first instruction of a block can be the target of a jump).
<p>
Each block is characterized by a list of its instructions and a list
of its successor blocks.
<p>
The basic-block graph can be described by a table:
<p>
<PRE>

   'table' BLOCK (Instructions: INSTRLIST, Successors: BLOCKLIST)
</PRE>

This introduces a table of records, where each record
has a field <tt> Instructions</tt> (of type <tt> INSTRLIST</tt>)
and a field <tt> Successors</tt> (of type <tt> BLOCKLIST</tt>).
It also introduces a new type, <tt> BLOCK</tt>,
the values of which are references to block records.
<p>
The type <tt> BLOCK</tt> can be used in the same way as any other type,
e.g. as the type of the fields of a term.
Hence we can define the type <tt> BLOCKLIST</tt> as usual:
<PRE>

   'type' BLOCKLIST
      list(BLOCK, BLOCKLIST)
      nil
</PRE>

A new record and its unique key are created by an <i> allocation statement</i>.
It has the form
<ul>
<li>

   <i>Var</i> <tt> ::</tt> <i>Name</i>
</ul>

This defines <i>Var</i> as a local variable of the key type <i>Name</i>,
holding a unique key of a fresh record.
The fields of this record are still undefined.
<p>
For example,
<PRE>

   B :: BLOCK
</PRE>
defines the variable <tt> B</tt> as a new key of a <tt> BLOCK</tt> record.
This key can already be used as a value in terms,
and it cannot be altered (hence terms still have the property
of being constants). But the associated record can be modified
by subsequent statements.
<p>
The fields of an entry can be modified and inspected
in exactly the same way as a global variable, i.e. by
update and query statements.
<p>
Instead of a simple variable name, a <i> designator</i> is used
that specifies the key and the field:
<ul>
<li>

   <i>Key</i> <tt>'</tt> <i>FieldName</i>
</ul>

For example,
<PRE>

   B'Successors
</PRE>
designates the <tt> Successors</tt> field of the record associated with the key
given by the local variable <tt> B</tt>.
<p>
An update statement
<PRE>

   B'Successors <- nil
</PRE>
sets this field to <tt> nil</tt>.
<p>
A query statement
<PRE>

   B'Successors -> L
</PRE>
accesses the field and copies its value into <tt> L</tt>.
<p>
With the statements
<PRE>

   B'Successors -> OldList
   B'Successors <- list(NewBlock, OldList)
</PRE>
a new block can be inserted into the list of successors of <tt> B</tt>.
<p>
It is a checked run-time error to access a field that has not been defined.
<p>
In general, the basic blocks of a program form a graph that contains cycles.
This can be expressed with tables, for example:
<PRE>


   'action' BuildLoop(-> BLOCK)

      'rule' BuildLoop(-> B1)

         B1 :: BLOCK
         B2 :: BLOCK

         B1'Instructions <- nil
         B2'Instructions <- nil

         B1'Successors <- list(B2, nil)
         B2'Successors <- list(B1, nil)
</PRE>
After an invocation
<PRE>

   BuildLoop(-> B)
</PRE>
<tt> B</tt> will refer to a block with one successor, the successor
of which is <tt> B</tt> itself.
