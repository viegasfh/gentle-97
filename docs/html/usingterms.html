<h1>Using Terms in Expressions and Patterns</h1>

When a <i> Gentle</i> program  is executed, the actual values of term types
are always ground terms.
But in the text of a program we also use terms that contain variables as
subterms (i.e. as arguments of a functor).
In the extreme case the whole term may be just one variable name.
A variable serves as a placeholder.
<p>
To avoid confusion, variables start with an upper-case letter,
and functors start with a lower case letter.
<p>
Variables need not be declared. Nevertheless, they are strongly
typed. The type is derived by the <i> Gentle</i> compiler,
and the use of the variables is checked for consistency.
<p>
Depending on the context in which they are used, terms appear in two roles:
as <i> expressions</i> and as <i> patterns</i>.
<p>
An expression is used to construct a term from given components.
<p>
If the variable <tt> Hd</tt> is of type <tt> Color</tt> and holds the value
<tt> red</tt>, and if the variable <tt> Tl</tt> is of type <tt> ColorList</tt>
and holds the value <tt> nil</tt>, the expression
<tt> list(Hd, Tl)</tt> yields the value <tt> list(red, nil)</tt>.
<p>
A value may be decomposed into constituents
by matching the value against a pattern.
<p>
If the value <tt> list(red, nil)</tt> is matched against the pattern
<tt> list(Hd, Tl)</tt>
the variable <tt> Hd</tt> is defined as <tt> red</tt>,
and the variable <tt> Tl</tt> as <tt> nil</tt>.
The matching succeeds.
<p>
If the value <tt> nil</tt> is matched against the pattern
<tt> list(Hd, Tl)</tt>,
the matching is said to fail.
<p>
Matching a pattern against a term means trying to find values for
the variables inside the pattern: replacing the variables by these
values makes the pattern equal to the term. 
For example,
replacing <tt> Hd</tt> by <tt> red</tt> and <tt> Tl</tt> by <tt> nil</tt>
turns the pattern <tt> list(Hd, Tl)</tt> into the term <tt> list(red, nil)</tt>.
