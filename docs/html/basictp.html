<h1>Numbers and Strings</h1>

<p>
In compilers written in <i> Gentle</i> most computations are carried out
on terms. In addition there are built-in types for numbers and strings.
<p>
The type <tt> INT</tt> comprises integer numbers.
<p>
They are denoted by sequences of decimal digits.
Expressions of type <tt> INT</tt> may be constructed from integer constants,
variables of type <tt> INT</tt>, or by applying an operator to subexpressions.
These operators are
monadic plus (<tt> +</tt>),
monadic minus (<tt> -</tt>),
addition (<tt> +</tt>),
subtraction (<tt> -</tt>),
multiplication (<tt> -</tt>),
and division (<tt> /</tt>).
The operators have the usual binding strength
(multiplication and division have a higher priority than
addition and subtraction, the monadic operators having highest priority).
Parenthesis may be used to explicitly indicate grouping.
<p>
Here are some examples of <tt> INT</tt> expressions:
<PRE>

   1024
   N+1
   A-(B-C)
   -K
</PRE>

The type <tt> STRING</tt> comprises sequences of characters.
<p>
Expressions of type <tt> STRING</tt> are string constants or
variables of type <tt> STRING</tt>.
A string constant is a character sequence enclosed in apostrophes
``<tt> "</tt>''.
Inside string constants certain characters must be
represented by an escape sequence:
``\"'' represents ``<tt> "</tt>'',
``\\'' represents ``\'',
``\n'' represents a newline character, and
``\t'' represents a tabulator.
<p>
Here are some examples of <tt> STRING</tt> expressions:
<PRE>

   "Hello World!"
   "The magic word is \"needed\"."
</PRE>
