<h1>Summary of the Language</h1>

<p>
     A computer program consists of two  essential  parts,  a  description  of
actions  which  are  to be performed, and a description of the data, which are
manipulated by these actions.  Actions are described by statements,  and  data
are described by declarations.
<p>
     The data are represented by constants and  values  of  variables.   Every
variable occurring in a statement must be introduced by a variable declaration
which associates an identifier and a data type with that variable.   The  data
type  essentially defines the set of values which may be assumed by that
variable.  The data type is directly described in the variable declaration.
<p>
     There exist three basic types: Boolean, integer, and real.  The values of
the  type  Boolean are denoted by reserved identifiers, the numeric values are
denoted by numbers.
<p>
     Array types are defined by describing the types of their  components  and
an  integer  range.   A  component of an array value is selected by an integer
index.  The type of the component is the component type of  the  corresponding
array type.
<p>
     The most fundamental statement is the assignment statement.  It specifies
that  a  newly  computed  value be assigned to a variable (or a component of a
variable).  The value is obtained by evaluating  an  expression.   Expressions
consist of variables, constants and operators operating on the denoted
quantities and producing new values.
<i> MiniLAX</i> defines a fixed set of operators, each
of  which  can be regarded as describing a mapping from the operand types onto
the result type.  The set of operators is subdivided into
<p>
<UL>
    <LI> Arithmetic operators: addition and multiplication
    <LI> Boolean operators: negation
    <LI> Relational operators: comparison
</UL>
<p>
The result of a comparison is of type Boolean.  The procedure statement causes
the  execution  of  the designated procedure (see below).
Assignment and procedure statements are
the components or building blocks of  structured  statements,
which  specify  sequential,  selective, or repeated execution of their
components.  Sequential execution of  statements  is  specified  by  statement
sequences,  selective execution by the if statement, and repeated execution by
the while statement.  The if statement serves to make  the  execution  of  two
alternative  statements  dependent  on the value of a Boolean expression.  The
while statement serves to execute a statement while a  Boolean  expression  is
true.
<p>
     A statement sequence can be given a name (identifier), and be  referenced
through  that  identifier.  The statement sequence is then called a procedure,
and its declaration a procedure declaration.  Such a declaration may
additionally  contain  a  set  of variable declarations and further
procedure declarations.
The variables and procedures thus  declared  can  be  referenced  only
within  the procedure itself, and are therefore called local to the procedure.
Their identifiers have significance only within the program text which
constitutes  the  procedure  declaration  and  which
is  called  the scope of these
identifiers.  Since procedures may be  declared  local  to  other  procedures,
scopes  may  be nested.  Entities which are declared in the main program, i.e.
not local to some procedure, are called  global.   A  procedure  has  a  fixed
number  of  parameters,  each  of  which is denoted within the procedure by an
identifier called the formal parameter.  Upon an activation of  the  procedure
statement, an actual quantity has to be indicated for each parameter, which can
be referenced from within the procedure through the  formal  parameter.   This
quantity  is  called the actual parameter.  There are two kinds of parameters:
value parameters and variable parameters.   In  the  first  case,  the  actual
parameter  is  an  expression  which  is evaluated once.  The formal parameter
represents a local variable to which the result of this evaluation is assigned
before  the  execution of the procedure.  In the case of a variable parameter,
the actual parameter is a variable, and the formal parameter  stands  for  this
variable.  Possible indices are evaluated before execution of the procedure.
