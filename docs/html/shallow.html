<h1>Shallow Backtracking</h1>

Using shallow
backtracking, a predicate invocation is elaborated as follows.
The rules are tested in the given order.
If a rule fails, the next rule is considered.
If a rule succeeds, the predicate succeeds and the result is determined.
If all rules fail, the predicate fails.
<p>
This implies that, when one considers a certain rule,
one can be sure that preceding rules were not applicable.
<p>
For example, a predicate <tt> max</tt> computing the maximum of two integers
(using the built-in predicates <tt> ge</tt> and <tt> lt</tt> for
the relations greater-or-equal and less-than)
that is defined by
<PRE>

   'rule' max(X, Y -> X): ge(X, Y)
   'rule' max(X, Y -> Y): lt(X, Y)
</PRE>
could also have been written as
<PRE>

   'rule' max(X, Y -> X): ge(X, Y)
   'rule' max(X, Y -> Y)
</PRE>
because the second rule is only used when <tt> X</tt> is less than <tt> Y</tt>.
The disadvantage is that now the rule cannot be understood in isolation.
<p>
This style is often used for abbreviation.
For example, a predicate <tt> kind</tt>
that maps the set of letters <tt> a</tt>, <tt> b</tt>, <tt> c</tt>, ... , <tt> z</tt>
onto the constants <tt> vowl</tt> or <tt> consonant</tt>
can be written is this way:
<PRE>

   'rule'  kind(a -> vowl)
   'rule'  kind(e -> vowl)
   'rule'  kind(i -> vowl)
   'rule'  kind(o -> vowl)
   'rule'  kind(u -> vowl)

   'rule'  kind(Other -> consonant)
</PRE>
where the last rule replaces 21 rules dealing with consonants.
Since none of the first five rules was applicable, we know that <tt> Other</tt>
is a consonant.
