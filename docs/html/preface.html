<h1>Preface</h1>

This book presents <i> Gentle</i>,
an integrated system for compiler writers.
<p>
<i> Gentle</i> supports the description of compilers at a very high level
and relieves users from the need to deal with implementation details.
It has been used in large industrial projects and for constructing
various commercial products.
Users report that <i> Gentle</i> significantly increases productivity.
<p>
<h3>Uniform Framework and Strong Methodology</h3>

<i> Gentle</i> provides a uniform framework
for specififying the components of a compiler.
<p>
The <i> Gentle</i> language was designed around a specific paradigm:
<i> recursive definition and structural induction</i>.
Input and internal data structures are defined by listing alternative ways
to construct items from given constituents.
Then the properties of these items are described by giving
rules for the possible alternatives.
These rules recursively follow the structure of items
by processing their constituents.
Experience has shown that this is the underlying paradigm of virtually
all translation tasks.
<p>

The same concepts apply to analysis, transformation, and synthesis.
They can be used to describe the backend of a compiler as
a simple unparsing scheme such as sufficies for most source-to-source
translations.
They can also be used to specify a cost-augmented mapping to a low-level
language which is used for optimal rule selection.
<p>
The rule-based approach follows the <i> principle of locality</i>:
complex interactions are avoided
and a system can be understood by understanding small pieces in isolation.
Individual constructs are described independently.
<p>
The paradigm leads to a <i> data-oriented methodology</i>:
the structure of data is mirrored by
the structure of algorithms.  
This methodology proves to be a useful guideline in compiler
projects.
<p>
<h3>Safety, Portability, Efficiency, and Openness</h3>

<p>
<i> Gentle</i> has been designed to enabale errors to be detected
as early as possible.
Although variables need not be declared, <i> Gentle</i> is a strongly typed
language that allows the compiler to check their consistent use.
Moreover, it can be ensured statically that each variable has a value when
it is accessed.
In cases
where static rule analysis
cannot prove that a program is well-behaved,
this is done at run time.
The violation of a language constraint is reported when it occurs,
not when it has disastrous consequences.
This drastically reduces debugging effort.
<p>
A specification written in <i> Gentle</i> can be translated automatically
into highly portable <i> C</i> code.
In many cases, the generated code is faster than hand written code.
<p>
Moreover, <i> Gentle</i> is an open language:
compilers can be written partly in <i> Gentle</i> and partly in <i> C</i>.
<p>
<h3>Organisation of this Book</h3>

This book provides a tutorial, reference manuals, and a case study:
<p>
The <i> Gentle Primer</i> gives an introduction to the <i> Gentle</i>
compiler description language.
After presenting the basic concepts using simple examples

(<a href="glance.html"><i>1.1 At a Glance</i></a>),

,
these concepts
are discussed in more detail in the following sections

(<a href="elements.html"><i>1.2 Elements of Specifications</i></a> -
<a href="syntaxdescr.html"><i>1.5 Describing Syntax</i></a>).

Then more advanced features
of <i> Gentle</i> are introduced

(<a href="external.html"><i>1.6 Using Types and Predicates Witten in C</i></a> -
<a href="projects.html"><i>1.14 Organizing Larger Projects</i></a>).

<p>
<i> Getting Started</i> explains how to install and use <i> Gentle</i>.
It describes the steps required to generate a compiler
from a given specification.
The <i> Language Reference Manual</i> gives a concise specification of the
<i> Gentle</i> compiler description language.
The <i> Reflex Reference Manual</i> describes a simple tool that facilitates
the construction of lexer specifications.
The <i> Library Reference Manual</i> describes some utility modules
that come with the <i> Gentle</i> system.
<p>
The <i> Case Study</i> discusses a compiler for a small
programming language.
<p>

<h3>Acknowledgments</h3>

<p>
<i> Gentle</i> is a descendant of Kees Koster's <i> CDL</i> compiler description
language <a href="references.html">[7]</a>. <i> CDL</i> was designed in 1969 and
used in a portable <i> COBOL-74</i> compiler of MPB,
in the <i> mprolog</i> system of SzKI, and to program
the <i> Mephisto</i> chess computer. 
<p>
<i> Gentle</i> <a href="references.html">[10]</a> was designed in 1989 at the GMD Karlsruhe Lab,
the group that also created the Karlsruhe <i> Ada</i> and <i> Modula</i>
compilers <a href="references.html">[12, 11]</a>,
the <i> BEG</i> backend generator <a href="references.html">[3]</a>,
and the <i> Cocktail</i> toolbox <a href="references.html">[4]</a>.
