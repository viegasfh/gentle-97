<h1>Rule Bodies</h1>

So far we have
discussed rules without bodies.
A <i> rule body</i> is a sequence of statements,
in most cases predicate invocations,
that can be used to break down the computation of the particular rule
into subtasks or to reduce a problem to another problem for which there is
a solution.
<p>
For example,
we could add a rule to the definition of predicate <tt> favorite</tt>
stating that <tt> jack</tt> prefers the same color as <tt> jane</tt>:
<PRE>

   'rule' favorite(jack -> X): favorite(jane -> X)
</PRE>
Consider the invocation
<PRE>

   favorite(jack -> C)
</PRE>

The new rule is selected (because the expression <tt> jack</tt> matches the
pattern <tt> jack</tt>), and its body is evaluated. This means that the invocation
<tt> favorite(jane -> X)</tt> is elaborated. This succeeds and defines <tt> X</tt>
as <tt> red</tt>. After processing the body the expressions constituting the output
parameters of the rule head are evaluated. Here the expression is simply a variable, <tt> X</tt>, which has just been defined as <tt> red</tt>. Hence, <tt> red</tt>
is the output value of the original invocation. So <tt> C</tt> is defined as
<tt> red</tt>.
<p>
It is very common for the rules of a predicate to directly follow
the type definition of its argument.
There is a rule for each alternative of the type,
and inside this rule the members of the body process the constituents of that
alternative. The result is given by combining the results of the members.
<p>
Assume that, besides lists of colors, we have also defined lists of persons:
<PRE>

   'type' PersonList
      list(Person, PersonList)
      nil
</PRE>
(We can use the same functors in both list type definitions because it is
clear from the context which type is meant.)
<p>
We now want to define a predicate <tt> favorites</tt>
that takes a list of persons and returns
a list of colors of the same length.
An element of the color list is the favorite color
of the person at the corresponding
position in the person list.
For example,
<PRE>

   list(julia, list(jane, nil))
</PRE>
is mapped to
<PRE>

   list(blue, list(red, nil))
</PRE>
We introduce two rules, each one handling an alternative of the above type
definition:
<PRE>

   'rule' favorites(list(Head, Tail) -> list(ColorHead, ColorTail)):
      favorite(Head -> ColorHead)
      favorites(Tail -> ColorTail)

   'rule' favorites(nil -> nil)
</PRE>

The first rule decomposes its argument into <tt> Head</tt> and <tt> Tail</tt>
and uses the suitable predicates to compute the favorite color
of the <tt> Head</tt> and the favorite color list of the <tt> Tail</tt>.
Given these values the resulting color list can be constructed.
<p>
The second rule simply has an empty body. For an empty person list we
return an empty color list.
<p>
A rule body is evaluated by evaluating its members in the given order.
If a member fails then the rule fails.
If all members succeed, then the rule succeeds.
<p>
A rule
<ul>
<li>

<tt>'rule'</tt> <i>A</i> : <i>B<SUB>1</SUB></i> <i>B<SUB>2</SUB></i> ... <i>B<SUB>n</SUB></i>
</ul>

can be understood as a logical statement
<ul>
<li>

<i>A</i> <strong> if</strong> <i>B<SUB>1</SUB></i> <strong> and</strong> <i>B<SUB>2</SUB></i> <strong> and</strong> ... <strong> and</strong> <i>B<SUB>n</SUB></i>
</ul>

For example,
the rule
<PRE>

   'rule' grandfather(X -> Z): father(X -> Y) father(Y -> Z)
</PRE>
can be read as
<ul>
<li>

the grandfather of <tt> X</tt> is <tt> Z</tt> <strong> if</strong><br>
(there is a <tt> Y</tt> such that)<br>
the father of <tt> X</tt> is <tt> Y</tt> <strong> and</strong><br>
the father of <tt> Y</tt> is <tt> Z</tt>.
</ul>
